            <p>“Hollywood in the 1920s is a super racy time,” says Curator Chelsey O’Brien. “Films were beginning to mature, they were dealing with adult content. They were sort of racy and projected images of women in power and making their own choices. There were off-screen stories of drugs and alcohol and partying and overindulgence and then the industry was rocked by really huge scandals: namely the death of Olive Thomas, the murder of William Desmond Taylor, and the alleged rape of Virginia Rappe by popular movie star Roscoe ‘Fatty’ Arbuckle. So, all of these things brought really widespread condemnation from religious, civic and political organisations. Many felt that the movie industry was really morally questionable so there was all this political pressure.”

            <p> “it was with the appointment of Joseph Breen by Hays as the new administrator that the restrictions became truly solid and filmmakers like Arzner started to see themselves pushed out of the business and into an early retirement. “I think that with the Hays Code, one of the things the film industry just assumed was that its audience was white and straight and only white, straight males,” says O’Brien. “They would do things that appealed to that audience base, really. Anything that was going to be questioning a woman’s sexuality or women’s sexual preference or even men’s sexual preference, there was this real return to traditional values. A little bit of that is we’re coming out of the Depression, we’re coming out of World War I, so there’s this general American sentiment that is returning to conservatism.”

The pansy image originated from the concept that homosexuality was simply gender inversion: pansies were exaggeratedly effeminate creatures, often characterized by high-pitched voices and feminine professions (e.g., fashion designers, hairdressers, etc.). The implication surrounding this stereotype, according to Benshoff and Griffin, is that “homosexual men were not considered ‘real men.’” Although the Production Code expressly prohibited, as Variety put it, “more than a dash of lavender,” it tolerated this “pansy comedy,” making it a common and easy target for humor.
